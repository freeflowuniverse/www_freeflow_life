# THE FOUNDATION
# _BEGINS WITH YOU_

<br>

FreeFlow Nodes can generate compute, storage and network capacity for your entire country. People deploy FreeFlow Nodes in homes, offices, schools, telco infrastructure or datacenters and generate income. 

<br>

Our unique operating system interconnects these nodes to create the FreeFlow Grid, your own sovereign and decentralized Internet. 

<br>
